What is the maximum sulfur content (in weight percent) allowed for carbon steel materials used in sour service under ASME B31.3?,The maximum sulfur content (in weight percent) allowed for carbon steel materials used in sour service under ASME B31.3 is 0.002.,"The ASME B31.3 piping code does not specifically dictate the maximum sulfur content for carbon steel materials used in sour service. Instead, it refers to the material standards (such as ASTM or ASME) that define the permissible sulfur content.

For sour service, the NACE MR0175/ISO 15156 standard is typically used alongside ASME B31.3. NACE MR0175/ISO 15156 has sulfur content limits for various carbon steel material grades.
